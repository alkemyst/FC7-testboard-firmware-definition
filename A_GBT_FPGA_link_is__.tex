A GBT-FPGA link is used to emulate the GBTx serial link [3], and can also be instantiated on back-end FPGAs. Clocking resources are external to the GBT Bank, providing the user flexibility with connecting the different clocks. Depending upon user requirements, the GBT-FPGA core can be implemented using one or more GBT links in two different modes:
1.	Standard 
2.	Latency-optimized (used when fixed, low and deterministic latency required for Tx, Rx, or both)
In addition, the GBTx offers two different encoding schemes:
1.	GBT-Frame mode (based on Reed-Solomon encoding)
2.	Wide-Bus mode (no encoding)
Both schemes use a 120-bit bus to/from a GBT-FPGA link operating at 4.8Gbps
