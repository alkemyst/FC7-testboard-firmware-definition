#Introduction
In the context of Phase-2 Outer Tracker module production a variety of front-end prototype variants will not be produced and consequently the DAQ system will have to address them.
In principle the test board should be able to control and readout front-ends with 
* 2×CBC3, 8×CBC, N×MPA
* With/without CIC
* With/without optical interface (GBTx, lp-GBTx)

If adequate DAQ system available, it can be used to address a large set of measurements/tests with these cards for
* Component testing
* System integration
* Beam tests

Both the uncertainty on the availability of components and the need to test different readout chains suggest that a modular approach to the test board construction is favored.
