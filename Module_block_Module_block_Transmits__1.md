##Readout block
Data mode: Manages memory readout and back-pressure Optionally could stream data to SFP+ connectors on the FMC (iif optical readout is present, one connector can be dedicated to fast streams) Data formatting for the DAQ, according to payload specs Performs post-scaling (to exercise fast trigger rates with limited bandwidth) Count mode: Used for commissioning: holds hit/cluster/stub counts per strip Takes care to add counters properly { as many counters as conditions (e.g. thresholds)
