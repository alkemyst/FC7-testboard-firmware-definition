\subsubsection{The GBT-FPGA wrapper}
The GBT-FPGA components are integrated into a module called the GBT Bank and a single bank may contain multiple GBT Links. While most of the components of a GBT Bank are common for most FPGA families, each link comprises a GBT Tx, a GBT Rx and a Multi-Gigabit Transceiver (MGT).
