\subsubsection{The GBT-FPGA wrapper}
The GBT-FPGA components are integrated into a module called the \textbf{GBT Bank} and a single bank may contain multiple \textbf{GBT Links}. While most of the components of a GBT Bank are common for most FPGA families, each link comprises a GBT Tx, a GBT Rx and a Multi-Gigabit Transceiver (MGT).
